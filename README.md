# PrimePalindromes

This repository contains several functions that find, use, or manipulate prime palindromes in various bases.

## Description of Each File

#### baseConvert.cpp 

This function converts the given number into base 2.

#### findPair.cpp

This function finds the palindrome pair for the given number in base 2.

#### primePairs.cpp

This function obtains all prime palindrome pairs up to a given number.

#### pp.cpp

Obtains a list of prime numbers such that it's mirror in any base between 2 and 10 is also a prime number.

#### primeAnalysis.R

Using the output from pp.cpp, this file graphs the percentage of prime numbers that have a prime mirror in some base 2-10 against the upperbound of numbers to consider.

#### xn.cpp

Outputs the primes that require an additional base to obtain a prime mirror in base 10. The generated sequence in base 10 is the Smaug sequence.

#### xnAnalysis.R

Outputs the primes that require an additional base to obtain a prime mirror in base 10. The generated sequence in base 10 is the Smaug sequence. Note that the output from pp.cpp is required.
